    * 0.4-07
    *
    * data/un86 - data set added
    *
    * R/CovSest.R, man/CovSest.Rd, R/CovControlSest.R, man/CovControlSest.Rd - 
    *   added two more estimation methods for the S estimates: bisqauare and
    *   Rocke type, as described in Maronna et al. (2006) - thanks to Matias 
    *   Salibian-Barrera for the provided code.
    *
    * R/CovMve.R, man/CovMve.Rd - now the raw cov matrix is properly scaled by 
    *   a factor  median(dist)/qchisq(0.5, p) and the reweighted cov matrix is
    *   multiplied by a consistency corretcion factor, similarly as in CovMcd().
    *   No finite sample correction factors are used. For details see ?CovMve.
    *
    * man/CovMve.Rd -  the search for the approximate solution is explained 
    *   (fast MVE) and the corresponding referecne (Maronna et al., 2006) is given.
    *
    * R/CovMest.R, man/CovMest.Rd - the default initial value now is the raw 
    *   (not reweighted) MVE estimate with the covariance matrix standardised 
    *   to det(cov)=1
    *
    * R/CovOgk.R, man/CovOgk.RD, src/covOPW.c, R/CovControlOgk.R, man/CovControlOgk.R 
    *   Added a C implementation for OGK - thanks to Kjell Konis. 
    *   See ?CovOgk for details
    * 
    * R/plot-utils.R - fixed a bug in plot(CovMcd(x), which="tolEllipsePlot", id.n=0) - 
    *   even if id.n was set to 0, at least one observation was plotted with a label
    *
    
2008-06-02  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.4-06
    * Added the 'bushmiss' - a group of data sets based on 'bushfire'
    *   with added incompliteness (MCAR) with probability 0.1, 
    *   0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 
    * Fixed minor errors in the documentation
    * Added PCA based on robust cov matrix - PcaCov
    * Added Spherical PCA algorithm - PcaLocantore
    * Added 'bus' data set - Automatic vehicle recognition data
    *   as an illustration for the PCA methods. The examples reproduce
    *   the corresponding examples from Maronna et al. (2006), page 213

2007-02-12  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.4-05
    * Added the OsloTransect data set
    * Fixed minor errors in the documentation
    * Fixed two serious problems in .fastMve() - there was a
    *   hard-coded seed setting and the half-sample was hardcoded too
    * Added S-estimates computed by either the FAST-S algorithm or 
    *   Ruppert's SURREAL

2007-11-10  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.4-03
    * R/plot-utils.R - "Squared Robust distance" changed to "Robust distance",
    *   added ylim parameter so that two parallel distance plots
    *   (robust and classic) will have the same scale
    * man/getCenter-methods.Rd - there was an 'unmatched right brace' in line 34 -
    *   shown as 'Note' in "R CMD install" but not in "R CMD check"
    * R/CovRobust.R - method 'plot' - make robust and classic distance
    *   plot same scale
    * Added function Cov() as an alias to CovClassic() for compatibility with
    *   previous versions
    * Function and class Robpca changed to PcaHubert - Robpca was too general
    * Added methods predict, screeplot and biplot for Pca

2007-10-24  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.4-02
    * Fixed the OO-hierarchy for robust location and scatter: now
    *   Cov is a VIRTUAL class and CovClassic added for representing
    *   the classic estimates

    * CovMve added, to be used as initial solution for CovMest

2007-09-28  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.4-01

    * Removed covMcd, ltsReg and all datasets which were already moved to
    * package robustbase. Now package robustbase is required and these
    * functions are used from there. This could cause some minor
    * incompatibilities because of changed parameters in covMcd(), like:
    *   - trace=FALSE instead of print.it=FALSE
    *   - seed=NULL instead of seed=0
    *   - changed structure and names of datasets

2007-09-24  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.3-08

    * Added ROBPCA - Robust Principal Component Analysis - with an
    *   S4 object model R/Pca.R, R/PcaClassic,  R/Robpca and
    *   man/Pca-class.RD, man/PcaRobust-class.Rd, man/PcaClassic-class.RD
    *   man/Robpca-class.RD, man/PcaClassic.RD, man/Robpca.RD

2007-09-20  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.3-07

    * Added classical and robust Wilks Lambda test - R/Wilks.test.R and
    * man/Wilks.test.RD

2007-07-05  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.3-06

    * Added one- and two-sample T2 Hotelling test and one-sample
    * robust T2 Hotelling test (Willems et al. 2002) - R/T2.test.R and
    * man/T2.test.RD

    * R/covMcd.R: usage of simulated finite sample correction factors fixed:
    * - case p=1 fixed
    * - simulated corrections used only when the Pison et.al.
    *   formula is definitely wrong (negative or very large)

    * Added the L-moments data sets from Hosking and Wallis (1997):
    *       Appalachia, Cascades, lmom32 and lmom33

    * Fixed print.mcd() to avoid conflict with package 'robust'
    *   (same class "mcd")

    * R/covMcd.R - the calculation of the consistency correction factor
    *   for the raw and reweighted MCD covariance replaced by a call to
    *   a function MCDcons()

    * R/CovRobust.R, Cov.R, AllGenerics.R, utils.R - fixed the plot
    *   method of CovRobust in case of singular covariance matrix

2006-12-21  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.3-05
    * fixed a bug in ltsReg (in the QQ-plot were plotted the residuals  instead
    *   of the standardized reisuals)
    * added dataset 'Fish Catch Data'
    * added dataset 'Hemophilia'
2006-09-07  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>

    * 0.2-6
    * a bug in ltsReg (rsquared) fixed
    * fixed CRLF line endings in FORTRAN sources
    * fixed a problem in covMcd: in case of p=1 and cov=[0], the cov matrix was
