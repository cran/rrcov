    * 0.4-05
    * Added the OsloTransect data set

    *   shown as 'Note' in "R CMD install" but not in "R CMD check"
    * R/CovRobust.R - method 'plot' - make robust and classic distance
    *   plot same scale

    * incompatibilities because of changed parameters in covMcd(), like:
    *   - trace=FALSE instead of print.it=FALSE
    *   - seed=NULL instead of seed=0
    *   - changed structure and names of datasets

    *   (same class "mcd")
