2005-09-20  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-8

    * 0.2-7
    * ltsReg: fixed a bug related to nsamp -> it was hard-coded = 500 
        in Fortran

        number of identified outliers
    * ltsPlot: help enhanced
    * covMcd, covPlot, tolellipse: tol.inv parameter changed to tol, 
        according the change in mahalanobis() in 2.1.0
    
2004-12-26  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-6
    * a bug in ltsReg (rsquared) fixed
    * fixed CRLF line endings in FORTRAN sources
    * fixed a problem in covMcd: in case of p=1 and cov=[0], the cov matrix was
        a double instead of a matrix, which resulted in errors in subsequent
        calls (e.g. determinant(mcd$cov) expects a matrix)

        coefficients ans$coefficients and ans$raw.coefficients were of size 2
    * error handling added in ltsReg in case of scale=0
