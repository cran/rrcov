    * 0.2-8
    * ltsReg: added formula interface
    * ltsReg: adde generic functions summary.lts and print.summary.lts
    * ltsReg: fixed a problem with reordering of the coeficients even in case
        without intercept

    * 0.2-7
    * ltsReg: fixed a bug related to nsamp -> it was hard-coded = 500 
        in Fortran
    * ltsPlot: default for id.n changed - instead of 3, now it is the 
        number of identified outliers
    * ltsPlot: help enhanced
    * covMcd, covPlot, tolellipse: tol.inv parameter changed to tol, 
        according the change in mahalanobis() in 2.1.0

    * 0.2-6
    * a bug in ltsReg (rsquared) fixed
    * fixed CRLF line endings in FORTRAN sources
    * fixed a problem in covMcd: in case of p=1 and cov=[0], the cov matrix was
        a double instead of a matrix, which resulted in errors in subsequent
        calls (e.g. determinant(mcd$cov) expects a matrix)
    * fixed a problem in ltsReg when p==1 and Intercept==FALSE - the vectors of 
        coefficients ans$coefficients and ans$raw.coefficients were of size 2
    * error handling added in ltsReg in case of scale=0

2004-09-16  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-5
    * several errors in doc fixed (ltsPlot.Rd, covPlot.Rd, aircraft.Rd)
    
2004-09-16 Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-4 
    * added Regression Diagnostic Plots - function ltsPlot()
    * ...added Normal QQ Plot of the residuals
    * ...added Standardized Residuals versus index plot
    * ...added Standardized Residuals versus fitted values plot
    * ...added Regression diagnostic plot
    * ltsReg: the responce variable Y added to the result object
    * covMcd: fixed a bug related to nsamp -> it was hard-coded = 500 in Fortran
    * covMcd: fixed a bug - in case of alpha=1
    * added S3 methods plot.mcd and plot.lts
    * the S3 methods print.mcd and print.lts moved to separate R files
    * added the stars data set (Hertzsprung-Russell diagram)

2004-07-13  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-3 
    * improved documentation of the datasets
    * added datasets aircraft and delivery
    * added Covariance Plots - function covPlot()
    * ...added Distance Plot - function distplot()
    * ...added Distance-Distance Plot - function ddplot()
    * ...added Chisquare QQ-Plot - function chi2qqplot()
    * ...added Tolerance Ellipse Plot - function tolellipse()
    * added function print.lts (for ltsReg result); included in the test tlts.R
    * added function print.mcd (for covMcd result); included in the test tmcd.R
    
2004-06-26  Valentin Todorov  <valentin.todorov@chello.at>
    * 0.2-2
    * fixed bug in Fortran: rfltsreg.f, xrfnbreak()
    * Depends >= 1.8 (it was >= 1.9, because of the bug above)
    * Parameter, controlling whether to perform intercept adjustment at each step added to ltsReg and its default value set to FALSE
